================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: Usage of potentially dangerous functions can lead to security vulnerabilities in code if not properly sanitized and validated.
Solution: Ensure all inputs are sanitized and validated. Replace usage of potentially dangerous functions with safer alternatives if available.

Vulnerability: CVE-2014-0094: Apache Struts ClassLoader Manipulation
Issue: In your web-based Java applications, attackers may manipulate ClassLoader to execute arbitrary commands and cause a denial of service (DoS).
Solution: Upgrade to a Struts version that is not affected. The vendor has released a version with a fix for the vulnerability.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: The use of user-controlled inputs in SQL queries can lead to an SQL injection vulnerability.
Solution: Use prepared statements or parameterized queries instead of concatenating user inputs into SQL queries.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Checking Hashcode with all properties being not null
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeAllPropsNotNull
  Description: This scenario is intended to verify the hashCode() method when all properties (author, isbn, and title) are not null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a valid object with all properties populated, which means none of the properties are null.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode() method on the object.
  Assert: Validate that a valid non-zero hashcode is returned.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures a non-null object returns a valid, non-zero hash value. Confirmation of the successful behavior of the hashCode() method for non-null properties is crucial when the object is used in a data structure requiring hashcode, like HashSet, HashMap, etc.

Scenario 2: Checking Hashcode with all properties being null
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeAllPropsNull
  Description: This scenario checks the hashCode() method when all properties (author, isbn, and title) are null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an object with all properties as null.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode() method on the object.
  Assert: Validate that the hashcode equivalent to 1 is returned.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures a null property object returns 1 as the hash value. This is essential for handling situations where the object is placed in a hash data structure and might prevent null pointer exceptions in hashCode() calculations.

Scenario 3: Checking Hashcode for different objects
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeForDifferentObjects
  Description: This scenario verifies that the hashCode() method produces distinct results for different objects.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up two distinct objects with different property values.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode() method on both objects.
  Assert: Validate that the hashcodes returned by each object are not the same.
Validation: 
  This assertion is critical in ensuring that unique objects are hashed differently, preventing false object equivalences in hashmap-like structures.
  
Scenario 4: Checking Hashcode consistency 
Details:
  TestName: hashCodeConsistency
  Description: This scenario verifies that the hashCode() method provides a consistent hashcode for the same object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a valid object.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode() method on the same object multiple times.
  Assert: Validate that the hashcode remains consistent across all calls.
Validation: 
  The assertion ensures that the hashcode for a particular object remains the same across different invocations. This is crucial for key-based data structures and ensuring the predictable functionality of these structures.
