================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: If other parts of your application construct SQL queries naively with string concatenation, and include unfiltered inputs in the concatenation, there's a risk of SQL injection.
Solution: Use PreparedStatement or similar encoding and binding methods.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Issue: If other parts of your application display user input without properly sanitizing it, there's a risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
Solution: Always sanitize user input if it's being displayed, use output encoding libraries when outputting user inputs.

Vulnerability: Security Misconfiguration
Issue: If the application is not properly configured, it can run with more permissions than it needs, expose unnecessary information, or fail to keep up with patches.
Solution: Strictly follow the principle of least privilege, always turn off unnecessary features, patch regularly and keep hardening your environment security.

"""
  Scenario 1: Valid Synopsis Setting Test

  Details:  
    TestName: testValidSynopsisSetting
    Description: This test is meant to check the valid synopsis setting for the method. It investigates whether the method is correctly setting the value of 'synopsis' variable as expected.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new object and set a variable synopsis with a character string.
    Act: Invoke the setSynopsis method using the created object with the appropriate parameters.
    Assert: Assert if the value of synopsis matches the expected outcome.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the setSynopsis method works correctly. If the synopsis after the execution matches the expected outcome, we can conclude that the method is performing its intended functionality.
    The test is required to ensure valid data processing and correct behavior of the application.

  Scenario 2: Null Synopsis Test

  Details:
    TestName: testNullSynopsis
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of setSynopsis when a null is passed as an argument.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new object and set the variable synopsis to null.
    Act: Invoke the setSynopsis method using the created object with null as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert if the value of synopsis is null after the execution.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the setSynopsis method correctly handles null values. If the value of synopsis after the execution is null, the method is accurately handling null inputs.
    This test is significant for robustness and error handling in the application.

  Scenario 3: Empty String Synopsis Test

  Details:
    TestName: testEmptySynopsis
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of setSynopsis when an empty string is passed as the argument.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new object and set the variable synopsis to an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the setSynopsis method using the created object with an empty string as the parameter.
    Assert: Assert if the value of synopsis is an empty string after the execution.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify if the setSynopsis method appropriately handles empty string inputs. If the value of synopsis after the execution matches an empty string, the method is correctly handling such inputs.
    This test is significant for ensuring robust data handling and correct application behavior.
