Scenario 1: Test book constructor for initiating a Book object

Details:  
  TestName: testBookObjectInitiation
  Description: The test will validate if a Book object can be created successfully. The focus is to confirm that the object creation does not produce any errors or exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: There is no actual arrangement required as such since it's a default constructor.
  Act: A new Book object is created using the Book constructor.
  Assert: Validate that the created object is not null and is an instance of the Book class.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the Book object is successfully created and it's not null. This test is significant to ensure that a Book instance can be smoothly developed without any exceptions or errors.

Scenario 2: test Book constructor for initiating default parameters

Details:
  TestName: testBookDefaultParameters
  Description: The test checks that all the default parameters for a new Book object get initialized to their default values (whatever they may be; null, zero, etc) when created with the default constructor.
Execution:
  Arrange: Again, no actual arrangement since it's a default constructor.
  Act: Create a new Book object using the Book constructor.
  Assert: For each field in the Book object, it is checked that it matches the default value that should have been assigned by the default constructor.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the creation of a book with the default constructor initializes all parameters to their correct default values. This test is important because it guarantees that books are always created in a consistent state and that no unexpected values are introduced during object initiation.

Scenario 3: Test proper allocation of memory at instantiation

Details:
  TestName: testBookMemoryAllocation
  Description: This test is to ensure that appropriate memory space has been allocated once the Book object is created.
Execution:
  Arrange: No actual arrangement since it's a default constructor.
  Act: A new Book object is created using the class constructor.
  Assert: Check whether the book object holds some space in memory.
Validation: 
  This assertion confirms if indeed memory allocation happens at the instantiation of the Book object. The test is necessary to preempt any Null Pointer Exception that may arise when trying to operate on an object that doesn't exist in memory.
