================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper Implementation of Equals Method
Issue: Potential security vulnerabilities can arise if 'equals()' method is not properly implemented or incorrectly overridden. An incorrectly implemented equals method may cause unexpected behavior or result in issues that could be exploited.
Solution: Follow all contract rules for implementing equals() method. You should check if the passed object is an instance of the correct type, and then compare the fields that contribute to equals semantics.

Vulnerability: Potential Null Pointer Dereference
Issue: There is a possibility of a Null Pointer Exception(NPE) if 'books' field is null. An NPE can cause a program to terminate unexpectedly and maybe exploited.
Solution: Add null checks before accessing 'books' field. Essentially, ensure that the 'books' variable is not null before attempting to call methods on it.

""" 
  Scenario 1: Test to match the same object 

  Details:  
    TestName: testMatchingSelf.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method correctly identifies that an object is equal to itself. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a Cart object with some values. 
    Act: Invoke the equals method passing the same object as parameter. 
    Assert: Returns true.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that an object is equal to itself.
    This test is significant to ensure that the equals method correctly identifies matching objects.

  """ 

  """
  Scenario 2: Test to match null object 
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testMatchingNull.
    Description: This test is meant to confirm if the equals method can correctly identify that an object is not equal to null. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a Cart object with some values. 
    Act: Invoke the equals method passing null as parameter.
    Assert: Returns false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that an object is not equal to null.
    This test is important to ensure that the equals method can handle null values without crashing.    

  """ 
  
  """
  Scenario 3: Test to match different class object 
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testMatchingDiffClass.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the equals method can correctly identify objects of different classes. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a Cart object and an object of a different class. 
    Act: Invoke the equals method passing the different class object as parameter.
    Assert: Returns false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that an object is not equal to an object of a different class.
    This test is important to ensure the equals method can distinguish between different classes.

  """ 
  
  """
  Scenario 4: Test to match same class but different books 
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testMatchingSameClassDiffBooks.
    Description: This test checks if the equals method identifies two objects of the same class with different books are not equal.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up two Cart objects with differing books list. 
    Act: Invoke the equals method passing the different Cart object as parameter.
    Assert: Returns false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that two objects of the same class with different books property are not equal.
    This test is important to ensure the equals method can distinguish between objects with differing properties.

  """ 

  """
  Scenario 5: Test to match same class but different purchase status 
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testMatchingSameClassDiffPurchase.
    Description: This test checks if the equals method identifies two objects of the same class with different purchase status are not equal.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up two Cart objects with different purchase status.  
    Act: Invoke the equals method passing the different Cart object as parameter.
    Assert: Returns false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that two objects of the same class but different purchase status are not equal.
    This test is important to ensure the equals method can distinguish between objects with differing properties.

  """ 
  
  """
  Scenario 6: Test to match two equal Cart objects 
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testMatchingEqualCarts.
    Description: This test checks if the equals method correctly identifies two equivalent Cart objects.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two Cart objects with identical properties. 
    Act: Invoke the equals method passing the identical Cart object as parameter.
    Assert: Returns true.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that two equivalent Cart objects are indeed equal.
    This test is important to validate the intended behavior of the equals method in correctly identifying matching object instances.
