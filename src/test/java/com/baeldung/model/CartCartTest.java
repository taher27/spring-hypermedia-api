ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=Cart_3138bf0be8

Scenario 1: Verify the Initial Creation of Cart
Details:  
  TestName: verifyCartCreation 
  Description: This test checks if a new cart is successfully created and that it is initially empty.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Cart object.
    Act: Check the size of the book list in the cart.
    Assert: Confirm that the size of the book list is zero.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that a new Cart does not contain any books as it is newly created and supposed to be empty.

Scenario 2: Validate the Type of Book List After Cart Creation
Details:  
  TestName: validateBookListType 
  Description: This test checks if a newly created cart contains the book list of type ArrayList.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Cart object.
    Act: Get the class name of the book list in the cart.
    Assert: Confirm that the class name of the book list is ArrayList.
  Validation: 
    The assertion ensures that the Book List is implemented as an ArrayList. This is important to maintain consistency across the application.

Scenario 3: Test for Null Book List
Details:  
  TestName: checkForNullBookListInCart 
  Description: This test checks if the book list in a created cart is not null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create new Cart object.
    Act: Check if the book list in the cart is null or not.
    Assert: Confirm that the book list is not null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the Book List is not null after the Cart object is created. It ensures that the cart maintains an empty list by default instead of a null value.

Scenario 4: Assess the Assignment of New Book List to Cart
Details:  
  TestName: assessAssignmentOfNewBookList 
  Description: This test verifies if a new book list can be successfully assigned to an existing cart.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Cart object and create a new List of Books.
    Act: Assign the List of Books to the Cart and check the size of the book list in the cart.
    Assert: Confirm that the size of the book list in the cart is equal to the size of the assigned book list.
  Validation: 
    The assertion checks if we can assign a new book list to a cart. This is required while adding more books to the cart. 

Scenario 5: Testing Exception Handling when Adding Null Book List to Cart
Details:  
  TestName: testExceptionOnAddingNullBookList 
  Description: The test checks if the program handles exceptions when a null book list is added to the cart.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new Cart Object. Create a null List of Books.
    Act: Try to assign the null List of Books to the Cart.
    Assert: An Exception must be thrown.
  Validation: 
    The assertion checks if the programme correctly throws an exception when a null list of books is added to the cart. This is important to prevent ugly crashes of the application.
