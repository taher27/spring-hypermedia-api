================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs CWE-532
Issue: The variable 'isbn' appears to be a sensitive piece of information. If an exception occurs and the error message or stack trace is logged without handling, the 'isbn' may be exposed in logs.
Solution: Avoid logging sensitive information. If needed, make use of tools/libraries like Log4j or SLF4j to 'mask' sensitive data before logging.

Vulnerability: Inadequate Validation CWE-20
Issue: The 'setIsbn' method does not seem to perform any validation on the input 'isbn'. An attacker could provide an unexpected value, which could lead to further vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, etc.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize input data. Use tools and libraries for validation like Apache's Commons Validator.

Vulnerability: Missing Access Control CWE-285
Issue: The 'setIsbn' method is public, implying it can be accessed from anywhere within the application. If this method performs any sensitive operation or access sensitive data, this could pose a security risk.
Solution: Ensure proper access control mechanisms are in place. If this function isn't intended for use everywhere, consider reducing its visibility or implementing access control checks.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Verify the functionality of setIsbn when valid isbn is entered.
Details:  
  TestName: checkSetIsbnWithValidInput
  Description: This test is intended to check the 'setIsbn' method with valid isbn as input. Successful execution should change the value of 'isbn' without any exceptions.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create instance of relevant class. Declare valid 'isbn'. 
    Act: Call 'setIsbn' method with the valid 'isbn'.
    Assert: Compare the 'isbn' of instance with the input 'isbn' using getIsbn method.
  Validation: 
    This test aims at validating correctness of setIsbn method when valid input is provided. A successful test indicates that isbn value is properly set and fetched without any exceptions.

Scenario 2: Test scenario to set null as isbn.
Details: 
  TestName: checkSetIsbnWithNullInput
  Description: This test aims to validate the behavior of 'setIsbn' method when setting null as 'isbn'.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create instance of relevant class.
    Act: Call 'setIsbn' method with null.
    Assert: Compare the 'isbn' of instance with null using getIsbn method.
  Validation: 
    The purpose of this test is to check if the method handles null values gracefully. If the test passes, it suggests that the method is capable of handling null input (if there is a need to set null as isbn).

Scenario 3: Test scenario for holding empty string as isbn.
Details: 
  TestName: checkSetIsbnWithEmptyInput
  Description: This test checks the 'setIsbn' method by trying to set isbn as an empty string and assert if it's done correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create instance of relevant class.
    Act: Call 'setIsbn' method with an empty string as parameter.
    Assert: Assert if the 'isbn' of instance matches with the empty string using getIsbn method.
  Validation: 
    This test is ensuring that setting an empty string as isbn is handled correctly. If the test passes, it suggests that the method can handle edge cases where isbn is set as an empty string.

Scenario 4: Test scenario for setting isbn having special characters.
Details: 
  TestName: checkSetIsbnWithSpecialChars
  Description: The test aims to check the behavior of 'setIsbn' method when the isbn contains special characters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create instance of relevant class. Declare 'isbn' with special characters. 
    Act: Call 'setIsbn' method with 'isbn' as parameter.
    Assert: Compare the 'isbn' of instance with the input 'isbn' using getIsbn method.
  Validation: 
    Asserting on the outcome, whether the special characters are preserved when setting as isbn. Succeeding states the isbn is set with no changes or loss in data.
