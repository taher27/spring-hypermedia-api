ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=hashCode_5a2657087a

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Potential Null Object Access
Issue: The access to a null object can lead to a NullPointerException, disrupting the normal flow of the program. This can be leveraged by an attacker in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
Solution: Perform null checks before accessing methods or properties of objects to ensure they are not null. Wrap object access within a try-catch block to handle potential NullPointerExceptions.

Vulnerability: Inconsistent Hashcode Values Across Different JVM Instances
Issue: If the 'books' object relies on the default implementation of the hashCode method, the result may vary across different JVM instances. This can lead to inconsistent behaviors within distributed systems.
Solution: Overwrite the hashCode method in 'books' objects to return a consistent hash value across different JVM instances to ensure reliable performance in distributed systems.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Scenario with Empty Available Books and Purchased Status as False.

Details:
TestName: testEmptyBooksWithPurchaseFalse.
Description: This test is meant to validate the scenario where there are no books (null case), and the purchased flag is set to false. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up books as null and purchased as false. 
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results of hashCode against expected outcomes.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode returns the correct value for provided parameters. 
  This test scenario is significant as it validates the core functionality of the hashCode method.

Scenario 2: Test Scenario with Empty Available Books and Purchased Status as True.

Details:
TestName: testEmptyBooksWithPurchaseTrue.
Description: This test is meant to validate the scenario where there are no books (null case), and the purchased flag is set to true. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up books as null and purchased as true.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode returns the correct value for provided parameters. 
  This test scenario is crucial as it verifies the hashcode generation when no books are available, but purchased status is true. 

Scenario 3: Test Scenario with Available Books and Purchased Status as False.

Details:
TestName: testAvailableBooksWithPurchaseFalse.
Description: This test scenario check where there are books available and purchased flag is set to false. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set available books and set purchased as false.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode returns the correct value for provided parameters. 
  This test scenario is significant as it checks the hashcode generation when books are available but not purchased.
  
Scenario 4: Test Scenario with Available Books and Purchased Status as True.

Details:
TestName: testAvailableBooksWithPurchaseTrue.
Description: This test scenario checks where there are books available, and the purchased flag is set to true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set-up available books and set purchased status as true.
  Act: Invoke the hashCode method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the hashCode returns the correct value for provided parameters.
  This test is significant as it covers the scenario where books are available, and they are purchased. It affirms that the hashCode method correctly reflects the object's state.
