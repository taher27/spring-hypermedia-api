================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: The code may unintentionally provide unsafe access permissions to sensitive data. In cases where these getter methods are used to retrieve sensitive data, problems can arise.
Solution: Make sure to use proper access level modifiers. Model classes are typically accompanied with other methods that might leak sensitive information. Always use getter and setter methods appropriately to control access.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: If getter methods like "getSynopsis" are used without any form of access control, then private information might be exposed. This could be misused by malicious actors for varied purposes.
Solution: Implementing an Access Control List (ACL) or some form of access control can help mitigate this issue.

Vulnerability: CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ('XXE')
Issue: When working with XML inputs or serialization/deserialization, Java code might be vulnerable to dangerous XML External Entity (XXE) attacks. Attackers could exploit this by introducing malicious payloads.
Solution: Beware of the possibility of an XXE attack. Be particularly aware when using libraries susceptible to these attacks, such as the Jackson library used in the code segment.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate correct synopsis is returned

Details:  
  TestName: getSynopsisReturnsCorrectSynopsis
  Description: This test will verify that the getSynopsis method returns the expected synopsis string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a valid synopsis string. 
  Act: Invoke the getSynopsis method.
  Assert: verify that the returned synopsis from the method is same as the initialized synopsis.
Validation: 
  This assertion validates that the method correctly returns the synopsis. The synopsis being returned as expected ensures that the method is retrieving the desired property from the entity.

Scenario 2: Confirm case-sensitive return of the synopsis

Details:  
  TestName: getSynopsisReturnsCaseSensitiveSynopsis
  Description: This test will verify that the getSynopsis method is returning strings in a case-sensitive manner.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the synopsis with a string combining uppercase and lowercase letters. 
  Act: Invoke the getSynopsis method.
  Assert: Compare the returned synopsis with the original, confirming case preservation.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly maintains the case of the synopsis string. Which is important to keep the case sensitivity of strings.

Scenario 3: Validate return with Special Characters synopsis

Details:  
  TestName: getSynopsisReturnsSpecialCharactersSynopsis
  Description: This test will confirm that special characters in the synopsis are returned correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the synopsis with a string containing special characters. 
  Act: Invoke the getSynopsis method.
  Assert: Verify the returned synopsis correctly includes the special characters.
Validation: 
  This assertion checks that the method correctly preserves any special characters in the synopsis. This is important for data integrity if special characters are used within synopsis.

Scenario 4: Return synopsis with White Spaces

Details:  
  TestName: getsynopsisReturnsSynopsisWithWhiteSpaces
  Description: This test will verify that white spaces in the synopsis are preserved when it is returned.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the synopsis with a string that includes white spaces. 
  Act: Invoke the getSynopsis method.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned synopsis correctly includes the white spaces.
Validation: 
  This checks that the method correctly maintains any white spaces in the synopsis. This is vital for preserving the original formatting and readability of the synopsis.

Scenario 5: Empty synopsis 

Details:  
  TestName: getSynopsisReturnsEmptySynopsis
  Description: This test will verify that the getSynopsis method returns an empty string if the synopsis is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the synopsis with an empty string. 
  Act: Invoke the getSynopsis method.
  Assert: Verify that the returned synopsis is an empty string.
Validation: 
  This checks that the method correctly handles and returns an empty synopsis. This would be important when checking for synopsis that may not have been provided or entered.
