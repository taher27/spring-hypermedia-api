================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Memory Allocation CWE-789
Issue: Your 'equals' method can be exploited to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) due to excessive memory consumption. If an attacker crafts an instance of 'Book' with very large 'author', 'title', and 'isbn' fields, they could potentially overload your system's memory when 'equals' is called.
Solution: Consider implementing input validation or controls to prevent such memory allocation. You can set reasonable constraints on the length of these strings. Apache's StringUtils provides helpful checks such as isNotBlank() and length().

Vulnerability: Insecure Object Equality - Instance Comparison CWE-595
Issue: The 'equals' method checks for object equality using instance comparison (getClass() != obj.getClass()). This may lead to incorrect results if a subclass of Book is passed to the method.
Solution: Replace the instance comparison check 'getClass() != obj.getClass()' with '!(obj instanceof Book). This will return true if 'obj' is a subclass of Book, preserving the meaningful semantics of the equals method.

Vulnerability: Redundant Null-checks CWE-476
Issue: Your 'equals' method performs unnecessary null-checks. If the fields 'isbn', 'title', or 'author' are null, Java will return false when comparing them to non-null values without throwing a NullPointerException.
Solution: You can simplify your logic and remove redundant null-checks by comparing fields directly. For instance, replace 'if (author == null) {...} else if (!author.equals(other.author))' with 'if (!Objects.equals(author, other.author))'. The Objects.equals() method is null-safe and eliminates the need for explicit null-checks.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to validate when the same object is passed in equals method

Details:  
  TestName: sameObjectPassedInEqualsMethod.
  Description: The test is meant to check the internally comparing logic of equals method, when the same reference object is passed. As per the business logic if the same object is passed, it should return true.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a book object for testing.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing the same book object as the parameter.
  Assert: Assertion will be validating if the outcome is true.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when the same book object is compared with itself. The expected result is true because we are comparing the same object and by the logic of the equals method, it should return true.

Scenario 2: Test to validate when a null object is passed in equals method

Details:  
  TestName: nullObjectPassedInEqualsMethod.
  Description: The test is meant to check how equals method handles the situation when a null object is passed to it. As per the business logic if a null object is passed, it should return false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a book object for testing.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing a null object as the parameter.
  Assert: Assertion will be validating if the outcome is false.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when a null object is compared with a book object. The expected outcome is false because we are comparing with a null object and by the logic of the equals method, it should return false.

Scenario 3: Test to validate when objects from different classes are passed in equals method

Details:  
  TestName: differentClassObjectPassedInEqualsMethod.
  Description: The test is meant to check if equals method correctly identifies objects from different classes and handles them as per the business logic of returning false.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up objects of 'Book' class and some other class for testing.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing an object of a different class.
  Assert: Assertion will be validating if the outcome is false.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when an object of different class is compared with a book object. The expected outcome is false as per the equals method logic hence validating that the equals method is functioning correctly.  

Scenario 4: Test to validate when objects from same class but different attribute values are passed in equals method

Details:  
  TestName: sameClassDifferentAttributeValueObjectPassedInEqualsMethod.
  Description: The test is meant to check if the equals method correctly identifies objects from same class but with different attribute values and returns false as per the business logic.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up two 'Book' class objects with different values for testing.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing an object of same class but with different attribute values.
  Assert: Assertion will be validating if the outcome is false.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the equals method correctly identifies when an object of same class but with different attribute values is compared with a book object. The expected outcome is false as per the equals method logic, hence validating that it is functioning correctly.  

Scenario 5: Test to validate when objects from same class and same attribute values are passed in equals method

Details:  
  TestName: sameClassSameAttributeValueObjectPassedInEqualsMethod.
  Description: The test checks if equals method identifies objects from same class with same attribute values and returns true as per the business logic.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up two 'Book' class objects with similar values for testing.
  Act: Invoke the equals method, passing an object of same class and with same attribute values.
  Assert: Assertion will be validating if the outcome is true.
Validation: 
  This test verifies that the equals method is functioning correctly by identifying when an object of same class and with identical attribute values is compared with a book object. The expected result is true as per the business logic.
