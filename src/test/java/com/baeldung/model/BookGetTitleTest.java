================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References
Issue: This vulnerability can appear if an attacker can manipulate direct object references to access other objects without authorization. Given the simplistic nature of this getter function, it may be part of an entity that could represent such a direct object reference.
Solution: Dependency check can be done to prevent unauthorized access. Using access control mechanisms or replacing direct object reference with indirect ones as part of the solution.

Vulnerability: Missing Data Validation
Issue: This vulnerability appears when data is used without validation. There is no direct issue in the method or entity provided, but if validation is not done before the setTitle() method that presumably exists, there could be an issue of setting improper data.
Solution: Validation logic needs to be implemented during the setting of the title. Reject input that does not pass validation checks.

Vulnerability: Sensitive data exposure
Issue: If the entity that includes this title is serialized as part of @JsonView, sensitive data (if this title signifies sensitive information) might be unintentionally exposed.
Solution: If the title is sensitive data, avoid revealing it in JSON views, or use @JsonIgnore annotation to prevent it from being included in the serialized object.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test for successful retrieval of title

  Details:  
    TestName: getTitleSuccessfully
    Description: This test is meant to check the proper functioning of the getTitle method. The test is based on the scenario where the getTitle method is invoked, and a title is expected to be returned.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initiate an object and set the title attribute. 
    Act: Invoke the getTitle method without any parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned title against the value that was initially set.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the getTitle method successfully retrieves the title attribute which was previously set. The success of this test case signifies the proper functioning of the getTitle method.

  Scenario 2: Return Default Value

  Details:  
    TestName: returnDefaultTitleWhenNotSet
    Description: This test is to check the getTitle method's behavior when no title has been set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initiate an object without setting a title. 
    Act: Invoke the getTitle method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the default title is returned.
  Validation: 
    The assertion checks if the getTitle method can handle scenarios where no title is set and returns the default title. This is important to the robustness of the application, ensuring it can handle different scenarios gracefully. 

  Scenario 3: Title Handling for Null Values

  Details: 
    TestName: handleNullTitleGracefully
    Description: This test will validate how the getTitle method handles null values.
  Execution: 
    Arrange: Initiate an object and set the title as null. 
    Act: Invoke the getTitle method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if a null value or a predefined value for null cases is returned.
  Validation: 
    The validation checks if the getTitle method can properly return null or a predefined value when the title is set as null. This test ensures that the getTitle method can handle null values without causing execution problems.
