================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-496: Public Data Assigned to Private Array-Typed Field
Issue: Java classes often expose data fields directly, ignoring the concept of data hiding and encapsulation. This can lead to unauthorized data access or modification.
Solution: Adopt classic encapsulation technique: make your data fields private or protected, and control their access through getter and setter methods. Always validate incoming data for potential vulnerabilities.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing if the method returns true when the item is marked as purchased

Details:  
  TestName: testIsPurchasedTrue
  Description: This test is meant to check if the isPurchased() method returns true when the item is marked as purchased. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the boolean value of the 'purchased' variable to 'true'. 
  Act: Invoke the isPurchased() method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to assert that the returned value is 'true'.
Validation: 
  This test is meant to verify that the method works correctly when the item is marked as purchased. The expected result (true) is because the 'purchased' variable is set to 'true'. This test is essential to ensure the correct functioning of the purchase feature in the application.

Scenario 2: Testing if the method returns false when the item is not marked as purchased

Details:  
  TestName: testIsPurchasedFalse
  Description: This test is meant to check if the isPurchased() method returns false when the item is not marked as purchased. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the boolean value of the 'purchased' variable to 'false'. 
  Act: Invoke the isPurchased() method. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to assert that the returned value is 'false'.
Validation: 
  This test is meant to verify that the method works correctly when the item is not marked as purchased. The expected result (false) is because the 'purchased' variable is set to 'false'. This test is essential to ensure the correct functioning of the purchase feature in the application.

Scenario 3: Testing if the method properly handles null values

Details:
  TestName: testIsPurchasedHandlesNull
  Description: This test is intended to check whether the isPurchased() method can properly handle null values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the boolean value of the 'purchased' variable to 'null'.
  Act: Invoke the isPurchased() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to assert that the returned value is 'false'.
Validation:
  This test is designed to verify that the method works correctly when the 'purchased' variable is set to 'null'. The expected result (false) is because a null 'purchased' value should logically be treated as 'false' to avoid null pointer exceptions. This test is essential to verify the robustness of the application in handling unusual or unexpected input conditions.
