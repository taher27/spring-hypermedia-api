================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: While `getAuthor()` method provides public access to the `author` variable, make sure that the data it returns does not expose sensitive information, as it could lead to privacy violation issues.
Solution: Never expose sensitive information unintentionally. Review your data models to ensure fields that carry sensitive information are not being exposed through such public methods.

Vulnerability: CWE-566: Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key
Issue: If the `author` variable is used as a security control, it may be manipulated as it can be freely accessible through the `getAuthor()` method, bypassing authorization checks.
Solution: Do not use user input to control keys in security-sensitive operations. Ensure that authorization checks are robust and do not rely on user-controlled data.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: This code snippet may derive from debug code left in production. Such code could reveal system details through error messages, potentially providing valuable clues to malicious users.
Solution: Always ensure to remove debug code or sanitize your output before pushing your application to production. Log sensitive information responsibly.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Validate the return type of getAuthor method

Details:  
  TestName: testGetAuthorReturnType
  Description: This test is meant to check if the return type of the getAuthor() method is 'String'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Not required as getAuthor() does not need any data setup.
  Act: Invoke the getAuthor method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the return type is 'String'.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the return type of the getAuthor method is 'String', as expected. This is crucial as the method is supposed to return the author's detail, which must be a String.

Scenario 2: Check if getAuthor() returns the correct author

Details:  
  TestName: testCorrectAuthorReturned
  Description: This test is meant to verify if the getAuthor() method returns the expected author. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the field 'author' manually in the class in which the getAuthor() method is defined.
  Act: Invoke the getAuthor method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned string matches the author set manually.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that getAuthor() returns the correct author's information. This is important as the method must provide accurate author details.

Scenario 3: Check if getAuthor() returns null if no author is set

Details:  
  TestName: testNullWhenNoAuthorSet
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getAuthor() method returns null when no author has been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not set any author in the class where the getAuthor() method is defined.
  Act: Invoke the getAuthor method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that getAuthor() returns null when no author is set as it is the expected response.

Scenario 4: Check if getAuthor() returns an empty string if an empty string is set as the author

Details:  
  TestName: testEmptyStringWhenAuthorIsNotProvided
  Description: This test aims to verify if the getAuthor() method returns an empty string when an empty string has been set as the author.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set an empty string as the author.
  Act: Invoke the getAuthor method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is an empty string.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getAuthor method returns an empty string when an empty string has been set as the author, as it is the valid and expected response.
