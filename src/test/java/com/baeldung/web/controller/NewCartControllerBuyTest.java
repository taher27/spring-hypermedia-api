================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Hardcoded URL (CWE-15)
Issue: The code includes a hardcoded URL, which can be problematic if the domain or IP address changes, causing errors and preventing the application from accessing the desired resource.
Solution: Refactor the code to avoid hardcoding URLs. Consider externalizing these configurations, allowing you to change them without modifying the source code.

Vulnerability: Missing access control (CWE-285)
Issue: The 'buy' method does not seem to perform any access control checks, which can lead to unauthorized access.
Solution: Restrict access to sensitive methods using security annotations or security context in Spring security. Ensure only authorized users are allowed to perform privileged operations.

Vulnerability: Sensitive information exposure (CWE-200)
Issue: The 'buy' method returns a 'NewCartResource' that can potentially expose sensitive user data.
Solution: You should perform a data exposure analysis to understand what information is being exposed. If necessary, use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to ensure only necessary data is exposed.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test to validate successful book purchase

Details:  
  TestName: testBookPurchase
  Description: This test checks whether the purchase operation is successful when the cart is filled with books and the purchase operation is initiated.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock method initializeBooksInCart() to returns a list of books. Create a CartResource object with its purchased field set to true.
    Act: Call the 'buy' method with the created CartResource object.
    Assert: Validate that the returned NewCartResource's purchased field is set to true and a receipt link is present.
  Validation: 
    This test ensures that the buy method handles book purchasing correctly when the cart is full and the purchase operation is attempted.
    

Scenario 2: Test for purchase will not proceed if the purchase operation is not initiated

Details:  
  TestName: testBookPurchaseNotInitiated
  Description: This test checks whether the purchase operation is not completed when the purchase operation is not initiated even if the cart is filled with books.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock method initializeBooksInCart() to return a list of books. Create a CartResource object with its purchased field set to false.
    Act: Call the 'buy' method with the created CartResource object.
    Assert: Validate the returned NewCartResource with its purchased field set to false and receipt link is not present.
  Validation: 
    The test ensures that the buy method does not proceed with the purchase operation if it is not initiated.


Scenario 3: Test for purchase will not proceed if the cart is empty

Details:  
  TestName: testBookPurchaseEmptyCart
  Description: This test checks whether the purchase operation is not completed when the cart is empty even if the purchase operation is initiated.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock method initializeBooksInCart() to return an empty list. Create a CartResource object with its purchased field set to true.
    Act: Call the 'buy' method with the created CartResource object.
    Assert: Validate the returned NewCartResource does not have a receipt link.
  Validation: 
    The test validates that the buy method does not proceed with the purchase operation if there are no books in the cart.


Scenario 4: Test to validate a purchase will not proceed if the cart is null

Details:  
  TestName: testBookPurchaseNullCart
  Description: This test checks whether the purchase operation is not completed when no cart is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Do not create any CartResource object.
    Act: Call the 'buy' method with a null object.
    Assert: Validate that an exception is thrown when trying to perform a purchase operation with no cart.
  Validation: 
    This test ensures the buy method does not proceed with the purchase operation if there is no cart provided which covers edge cases and error handling within the application.
