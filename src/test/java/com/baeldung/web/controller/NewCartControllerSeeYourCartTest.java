================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: This vulnerability can manifest when the application inadequately or incorrectly validates inputs. It enables attackers to execute illicit operations.
Solution: Use java.util.regex package for input validation. Always apply server-side validation since client-side validation can be bypassed.

Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79)
Issue: XSS vulnerabilities occur when an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping, or updates an existing web page with user-supplied data.
Solution: Always encode user inputs. Use appropriate response headers to prevent XSS via response splitting. A Content Security Policy (CSP) also helps mitigate XSS attacks.

Vulnerability: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
Issue: SQL Injection vulnerabilities occur when unverified data is used to construct SQL queries, allowing attack vectors such as inserting operations or retrieving sensitive information.
Solution: Always use parameterized SQL queries or prepared statements, and never build SQL queries using raw user input.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) (CWE-639)
Issue: Occurs when a developer exposes a reference to an internal implementation object, such as a file, directory, database record, or key, as a URL or form parameter.
Solution: Avoid exposing direct object references to users, using indirect object references mapped by the server, or confirm proper access rights whenever direct object references are used.

Vulnerability: Sensitive Data Exposure (CWE-200)
Issue: This vulnerability occurs when sensitive data is not properly protected, allowing it to be read by unauthorized individuals.
Solution: Avoid exposure of sensitive information in URLs or error messages. Employ proper encryption where needed and minimise the use of sensitive data whenever possible.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Successful Cart Viewing
    
  Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessfulCartViewing
    Description: This test is meant to check if the seeYourCart method returns a properly initialized NewCartResource when called. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the initializeBooksInCart() and bookLinks(books) methods to return a list of books and the cartPurchased to return a boolean.
    Act: Invoke the seeYourCart method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check whether the returned NewCartResource includes the expected books list and cartPurchased status.
  Validation: 
    This test aims to verify that the method seeYourCart is able to return a properly structured NewCartResource. This is important to ensure that the user is able to view the books in cart and purchase status accurately.

Scenario 2: Test Empty Cart
    
  Details:
    TestName: testEmptyCart
    Description: This test is meant to verify that the seeYourCart method can handle scenarios where the cart is empty.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the initializeBooksInCart() to return an empty list of books and the cartPurchased to return false.
    Act: Invoke the seeYourCart method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned NewCartResource has an empty book list and cartPurchased status.
  Validation: 
    This test aims to verify that the method seeYourCart can handle an empty cart. This ensures proper functionality even if the user hasn't added any books to the cart.

Scenario 3: Test Cart with Purchased Status

  Details:  
    TestName: testCartWithPurchasedStatus
    Description: This test is meant to verify if the seeYourCart method returns a NewCartResource with the correct purchased status.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the initializeBooksInCart() to return a list of books and the cartPurchased to return true.
    Act: Invoke the seeYourCart method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned NewCartResource indicates the correct purchased status.
  Validation: 
    This test aims to confirm that the method seeYourCart maintains the correct purchased status of the cart. It ensures the user is properly informed of their purchase status.
  
Scenario 4: Test Cart with Non-purchased Status

  Details:  
    TestName: testCartWithNonPurchasedStatus
    Description: This test verifies if the seeYourCart method correctly handles a cart that hasn't been purchased.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the initializeBooksInCart() to return a list of books and the cartPurchased to return false.
    Act: Invoke the seeYourCart method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned NewCartResource indicates the correct non-purchased status.
  Validation: 
    This test aims to confirm that the method seeYourCart maintains the correct non-purchased status of the cart. It ensures the user is correctly informed they haven't completed their purchase.
