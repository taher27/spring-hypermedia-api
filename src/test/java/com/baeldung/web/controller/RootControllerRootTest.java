================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is an attack that tricks the victim into submitting a malicious request. In Spring Boot, CSRF protection is enabled by default.
Solution: Keep the CSRF protection enabled in Spring Security settings to prevent CSRF attacks.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Information Exposure occurs when system data or debugging information could be exposed to a user who is not supposed to have access to it.
Solution: Remove sensitive information from the responses and use Spring Security to secure the endpoints.

"""
  Scenario 1: Validate successful initialization of RootResource object through root method 

  Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessfulInitializationOfRootResource.
    Description: This test is to validate that the root method is correctly initializing and returning a new object of RootResource class. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup data is required as no parameters are needed for this method.
    Act: Call the root method. 
    Assert: Verify that the returned object is not null and is instance of RootResource class.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies if the root method is correctly creating a new object of RootResource class. This is crucial to confirm if the method is functioning as expected in creation and initialization of RootResource object.
      
  Scenario 2: Validate unique initialization of RootResource object through root method 

  Details:  
    TestName: testUniqueInitializationOfRootResource.
    Description: This test is to check whether the root method each time creates a unique instance of RootResource or not.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup data is required as no parameters are needed for this method.
    Act: Execute the root method twice to get two RootResource instances. 
    Assert: Check if the two returned objects are not same(i.e, they are different instances).
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies if the root method is returning unique RootResource instances every time it's called. This validates that the root method functions correctly in creating fresh instances rather than recycling.
 
  Scenario 3: Validate exception handling for root method

  Details:  
    TestName: testExceptionHandlingForRootMethod.
    Description: This test is to validate how root method handles possible thrown exceptions during the initialization of RootResource. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the RootResource class to throw an exception when a new instance is created.
    Act: Call the root method.
    Assert: Verify that the exception is properly caught and handled.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the root method is capable of effectively handling exceptions during the initialization of RootResource. This is important to ensure that the program handles exceptions gracefully and doesn't crash under unexpected conditions.


  Scenario 4: Validate RootResource object state after initialization

  Details:  
    TestName: testRootResourceObjectStateAfterInitialization.
    Description: This test is to check whether the root method creates a RootResource instance with correct default values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup data is required as no parameters are needed for this method.
    Act: Call the root method and get the RootResource instance. 
    Assert: Check the state of the RootResource object - any default values or properties should match expectations.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies if the root method not only creates a instance of RootResource but also initializes it with correct state. This ensures that the object is ready to use right after creation.
