================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Improper use or lack of input validation (OWASP Top 10 - CWE-20)
Issue: A common vulnerability is the lack of input validation, which can lead to issues like SQL Injection, Remote Code execution, and other vulnerabilities.
Solution: Always validate user inputs. You can use @Valid or @Validated annotations in API controller methods, Spring validation API, or Hibernate bean validation. Custom validation can also be done for complex scenarios.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) (OWASP Top 10 - CWE-639)
Issue: If there is an insecure direct object reference, an attacker could bypass authorization and access resources directly.
Solution: You can mitigate this issue by implementing proper Access Control Mechanisms, checking if the logged-in user has access rights to the requested resource.

Vulnerability: Exposed sensitive information in API Responses (OWASP Top 10 - CWE-200)
Issue: Returning sensitive data like passwords, private keys in your API responses can lead to information disclosure attacks.
Solution: Always sanitize and filter API responses. Avoid returning sensitive information. Use DTO (Data Transfer Object) to strictly control what data should be returned.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Normal flow where repository has books

Details:  
  TestName: testFindAllSummaryWithBooks.
  Description: This test is meant to check if findAllSummary() correctly finds all books and maps them to bookResources when the repository has some books.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the repository with a list of books. 
    Act: Call the findAllSummary() method.
    Assert: Compare the returned list of bookResources with the expected list of bookResources.
  Validation: 
    Check if the findAllSummary() method returns a correct list of bookResources when the repository has books. The expected result is the list of bookResources mapped from the books in the repository.

Scenario 2: Edge case where repository is empty

Details: 
  TestName: testFindAllSummaryWithEmptyRepo.
  Description: This test is meant to check what findAllSummary() will return when the repository is empty, i.e., no books to find.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Ensure the repository is empty.
    Act: Call the findAllSummary() method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned list of bookResources is empty.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the findAllSummary() will return an empty list if the repository has no books. The expected result is an empty list.

Scenario 3: Validating the mapping from Book to BookResource

Details: 
  TestName: testCorrectMappingFromBookToBookResource.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the mapping from a Book object to a BookResource object performed in the findAllSummary() is correctly done.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Add a known Book object to the repository.
    Act: Call the findAllSummary() method.
    Assert: Verify that the returned list of BookResource objects contains a correct mapping of the known Book object.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies if the mapping from a Book to a BookResource is correctly done by the findAllSummary(). The expected result is a BookResource object that correctly relates to the known Book object.

Please note that in the real-world scenario, there might be additional test cases to validate the scenarios like how the method handles null values or the behavior in case of an exception from the repo.findAll() method. However, in this test case, we are assuming that the repo.findAll() method always works as expected, and doesn't return null or throw exceptions.
