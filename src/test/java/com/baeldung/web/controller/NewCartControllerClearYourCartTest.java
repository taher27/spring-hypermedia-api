================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: SQL injection vulnerabilities arise when user-controllable data is embedded in SQL queries in an unsafe manner. An attacker could use such vulnerabilities to manipulate SQL queries, leading to unauthorized data manipulation or disclosure.
Solution: Use parameterized queries (also known as prepared statements) to ensure that user input is safely embedded in SQL queries.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur when user-controllable data is returned in HTTP responses without proper sanitization, thus enabling an attacker to inject malicious scripts. The injected scripts are executed in the context of the victim's browser, leading to session theft, account compromise, and various other impacts.
Solution: Output encode variables returned in HTTP responses, which are originating from user inputs.

Vulnerability: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Issue: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities occur when a malicious website can force a user's browser to send authenticated requests to a vulnerable application, causing unwanted actions to be performed on behalf of the user.
Solution: Implement anti-CSRF tokens which can serve as a challenge to ensure that the request is made by a legitimate user.

Vulnerability: CWE-643: Improper Neutralization of Data within XPath Expressions ('XPath Injection')
Issue: XPath Injection vulnerabilities occur when a website constructs XPath queries from user-supplied data without proper sanitization, which allows injection of XPath queries leading to unauthorized data disclosure.
Solution: Ensure to use parameterized XPaths or properly sanitize the user input used in XPath expressions.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Clearing an Already Filled Cart
  Details:  
    TestName: testClearingFilledCart.
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the clearYourCart method is accurately removing items from a previously filled cart. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a cart object and add a set number of book objects to it. 
    Act: Invoke the clearYourCart method on the cart object.
    Assert: Validate that the cart is empty after the method has been invoked. Make sure that cartPurchased is set to false.
  Validation: 
    This test will confirm the cart's ability to be cleared correctly. Correct functionality is crucial for ensuring customers can modify their orders as intended.

Scenario 2: Test Clearing an Already Empty Cart
  Details:  
    TestName: testClearingEmptyCart.
    Description: The aim of this test is to evaluate the clearYourCart method's behavior when invoked on an empty cart.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an empty cart object.
    Act: Invoke the clearYourCart method on this empty cart object.
    Assert: Assert that the cart remains empty after the invocation. Also, make sure that cartPurchased stays false.
  Validation: 
    The test verifies that invoking the clearYourCart method on an empty cart does not cause any unexpected behavior or exceptions. It's crucial for ensuring robustness of the application.

Scenario 3: Confirming cartPurchased Status After Clearing Cart
  Details:
    TestName: testCartPurchaseStatusAfterClearing.
    Description: The test confirms that the cartPurchased status is false after clearing the cart.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a cart object with various book objects and set cartPurchased to true.
    Act: Invoke the clearYourCart method on the cart object.
    Assert: Validate that cartPurchased becomes false after clearing the cart.
  Validation: 
    This test will confirm that the cart's purchase status is correctly reset to false after clearing the cart. This status condition is crucial for maintaining the correct state of the cart after operations.
