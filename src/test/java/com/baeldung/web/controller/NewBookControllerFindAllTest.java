================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Data Exposure (CWE-200)
Issue: The findAll() method retrieves and returns all books from the repository. This could potentially expose sensitive information if not properly handled.
Solution: Implement access controls and roles to limit who can call this API. Ensure any sensitive information is encrypted. Additionally, consider paginating results to limit the data exposed at any one time.

Vulnerability: Unvalidated Input (CWE-20)
Issue: There is no validation performed on the input. Corruption of input data could lead to unhandled exceptions or data integrity issues.
Solution: Validate input data before processing it. Java libraries such as Hibernate Validator can be used for bean validation.

Vulnerability: Predictable Resource Location (CWE-22)
Issue: The resource location for books is predictable, making it easier for an attacker to attempt malicious actions on known resource URLs.
Solution: Use unpredictable resource identifiers to prevent direct object references.

Vulnerability: Missing Authentication (CWE-287)
Issue: The submitted code does not show any authentication process. If this is not handled elsewhere in the application, unauthorized users may gain access to data or functions.
Solution: Implement a standard authentication process, such as protocol based on OAuth2 or JWT, to restrict access.

"""
Scenario 1: Test FindAll with multiple existing books records

Details:  
- TestName: testFindAllWithMultipleRecords
- Description: This test is meant to validate if the method findAll can fetch multiple book records from the repository correctly.
  
Execution:
- Arrange: Mock the BookRepository to return a list with multiple book entities. 
- Act: Invoke the findAll method.
- Assert: Assert that the fetched list is not empty and equals the predefined book list.

Validation: 
- The assertion validates if the fetched list is the same as the given in our mocked Book Repository. This ensures that the findAll method fetches all the books when the repo has multiple records.

Scenario 2: Test FindAll with empty book records

Details:  
- TestName: testFindAllWithEmptyRecords
- Description: This test checks the FindAll behavior when there are no book records present in the repository.

Execution:
- Arrange: Mock the BookRepository to return an empty list. 
- Act: Invoke the findAll method.
- Assert: Assert that the fetched list is empty.

Validation: 
- The assertion is verifying that the findAll method returns an empty list when no records are present. This illustrates the functionality of the findAll method in case of no records in the database.

Scenario 3: Test FindAll Exception Scenario 

Details:  
- TestName: testFindAllExceptionScenario
- Description: This test is to check the behavior of the findAll method while an exception is thrown during the method execution.

Execution:
- Arrange: Mock the BookRepository to throw an exception when the findAll method is invoked.
- Act: Invoke the findAll method.
- Assert: Assert an exception is thrown.

Validation: 
- The assertion aims to verify that the exception is thrown as expected when there is a problem accessing the database. This would help understand how the findAll method behaves during unexpected errors while fetching the records.
